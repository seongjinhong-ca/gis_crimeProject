Using BRIDGE AND CULVERT (STRUCTURE) Dataset in ESRI Shapefile Format WGS1984 LONGITUDE/LATITUDE Coordinate System.

The dataset is limited to the City of Toronto geographical boundary.
Shapefile format dataset works best if it opens with a GIS software that supports Shapefile format.
The Shapefile contains 16 fields and 1641 records.
The first field provides structure Id information, users should read the first field from top to bottom to find all structure records.
Each record contains information for a structure, users should read each record from left to right to find information about a structure.

Metadata information is as follows:
