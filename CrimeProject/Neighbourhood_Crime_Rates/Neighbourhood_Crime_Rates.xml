                <gco:CharacterString>Toronto Neighbourhoods Boundary File includes 2014-2021 Crime Data by Neighbourhood. Counts are available at the offence and/or victim level for Assault, Auto Theft, Break and Enter, Robbery, Theft Over, Homicide, Shootings and Theft from Motor Vehicle. Data also includes crime rates per 100,000 people by neighbourhood based on each year's Projected Population by Environics Analytics.This data does not include occurrences that have been deemed unfounded. The definition of unfounded according to Statistics Canada is: “It has been determined through police investigation that the offence reported did not occur, nor was it attempted” (Statistics Canada, 2020).**The dataset is intended to provide communities with information regarding public safety and awareness. The data supplied to the Toronto Police Service by the reporting parties is preliminary and may not have been fully verified at the time of publishing the dataset.   The location of crime occurrences have been deliberately offset to the nearest road intersection node to protect the privacy of parties involved in the occurrence. All location data must be considered as an approximate location of the occurrence and users are advised not to interpret any of these locations as related to a specific address or individual.NOTE: Due to the offset of occurrence location, the numbers by Division and Neighbourhood may not reflect the exact count of occurrences reported within these geographies. Therefore, the Toronto Police Service does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, timeliness of the data and it should not be compared to any other source of crime data.By accessing these datasets, the user agrees to full acknowledgement of the Open Government Licence - Ontario.In accordance with the Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, the Toronto Police Service has taken the necessary measures to protect the privacy of individuals involved in the reported occurrences. No personal information related to any of the parties involved in the occurrence will be released as open data. ** Statistics Canada. 2020. Uniform Crime Reporting Manual. Surveys and Statistical Programs.
